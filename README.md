### 3D Graphics Raytracer

This project is a 3D raytracing program that contains the following features:

- Customizable camera
- Multisampled anti-aliasing
- Rendering of primitive spheres and triangles
- Loading and applying/rendering custom textures and uv mapping [TODO]
- Performance speedup using using kd-trees/BVH for faster ray collisions in dense scene renders
- Simple diffuse, specular, dielectric, and emissive materials

- Rendering of quads (10)
- Motion blur and depth of field (10, 10)
- Perlin noise generator (10)
- Parallel computing of pixels (10)
Total: 50

### [TODO]

- Adaptive sampling [https://imae.udg.edu/~rigau/Publications/Rigau03B.pdf] (15)
- Importance sampling (15)
- Normal interpolation (5)
- Volumes (10)
- Subsurface scattering (BSSRDFs) (30)
Total: 50 + 75 = 115
