# 3D Graphics Raytracer

This project is a 3D raytracing program that contains the following features:

## Required Features
- Customizable camera
- Multisampled anti-aliasing
- Rendering of primitive spheres and triangles through ray/sphere and ray/triangle intersections
- Loading and applying/rendering image textures and UV mapping
- Performance speedup using using kd-trees/BVH for faster ray collisions in dense scene renders
- Simple diffuse, specular, dielectric, and emissive materials

## Additional Features
- Rendering of quads (10)
- Motion blur (10)
- Depth of field (10)
- Perlin noise generator (10)
- Parallelization on pixels (10)
- Adaptive sampling based on [this paper](https://imae.udg.edu/~rigau/Publications/Rigau03B.pdf) (15)
- Normal interpolation (5)

Total: 70

### [TODO]

- Volumes (10)
- Importance sampling (15)
- Subsurface scattering (BSSRDFs) (30)
Total: 50 + 75 = 115
